[OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/) is a well-known tool for editing, enriching and manipulating data. It is widely used within the Wikimedia community to add data to [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/).

In this practial 90 minutes workshop you will learn the basics of working with OpenRefine to manipulate data and add it to Wikidata. You will learn 
* how to create an OpenRefine project,
* how to manipulate and enrich data, and
* how to connect this data to databases such as Wikidata, [NTA](http://data.bibliotheken.nl/doc/dataset/persons) or [VIAF](https://www.viaf.org/).

## Target audience
This workshop is suitable for people who
* have some experience in working with (cultural heritage) data, 
* have not used OpenRefine before, 
* want to learn the basics of manipulating, enriching and linking data with this tool, but  
* who do not necessarily know what "reconciling against Wikidata" means.
